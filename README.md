## Performance Optimisation

1. The process of importing the `react-ace` editor was causing extended loading times on the page. To address this, I transformed it into a lazily loaded component utilizing `React.lazy()`. This approach employs code-splitting and defers the loading of the editor until needed.

2. Selectively importing specific modules from a library for use in a component, rather than importing the entire library.
